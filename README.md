# TestCharacteristics
An attempt to visualise test characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV.

A fixed population of 10,000 is used.  the sliders are used to adjust disease prevalance, sensitivity and specificity - and displays a confusion matrix, test calculations and a visualisation graphic based on this.

A particular use case is to see how disease prevelance affects positive and negative predictive values
